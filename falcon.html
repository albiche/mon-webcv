						<h1 class="major">FALC'ON: Simplifying Communication</h1>
						<p>FALC'ON is an innovative project incubated at EFREI Paris, aimed at transforming standard text into 'Facile à Lire et à Comprendre' (FALC), making information accessible to people with disabilities, the elderly, those with dyslexia, or non-native French speakers. As a recently joined member of the FALC'ON team, my mission is to enhance the AI model that underpins our text transcription services.</p>
						
						<p>FALC'ON leverages cutting-edge AI to simplify complex texts into versions that are shorter, easier to understand, and well-illustrated. This initiative not only promotes inclusivity but also assists public services, businesses, and organizations in making their administrative documents accessible to all. Our goal is to standardize accessibility in communication, ensuring everyone can understand essential information effortlessly.</p>
						
						<h2>My Role and Contributions</h2>
						<p>Upon joining the FALC'ON team, my immediate task involves developing a tool for formatting the output documents post-transcription. This tool will ensure that the transcribed documents adhere to the FALC standards, which involve a specific layout that facilitates easier comprehension. This involves automating the inclusion of visual aids, managing text layout, and ensuring that the language used is appropriate for all audiences.</p>
						
						<p>In the long term, my focus will shift towards significantly enhancing the AI model used in FALC'ON. This involves experimenting with several advanced AI techniques and tools, including generative AI models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and contextualization strategies to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of our text simplification processes. These technologies will allow FALC'ON to handle a broader range of document types and complexities, adapting the content to meet FALC standards dynamically.</p>
